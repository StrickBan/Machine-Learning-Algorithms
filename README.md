# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
I used Ridge Regresion, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network models on different datasets. I implemented a "by hand" version of every algorithm and then implemented the same algorithm using the Scikit library to compare results.
## Results

### Ridge Regresion

| Dataset | Implementation | Accuracy |
|  :-- | :--- | :--- |
| Breast Cancer | By hand | 97.20% |
| Breast Cancer | Scikit | 97.20% |
| Wine | By hand | 96.96% |
| Wine | Scikit | 96.96% |

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

| Dataset | Implementation | Accuracy |
|  :-- | :--- | :--- |
| Breast Cancer | By hand | 95.80% |
| Breast Cancer | Scikit | 97.20% |
| Wine | By hand | 100% |
| Wine | Scikit | 100% |

### Neural Networks

| Dataset | Implementation | Accuracy |
|  :-- | :--- | :--- |
| MNIST | By hand | 94.15% |
| MNIST | Scikit | 97.77% |
| Iris | By hand | 97.36% |
| Iris | Scikit | 97.36% |
